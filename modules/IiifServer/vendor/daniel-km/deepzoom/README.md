Deepzoom (php library)
======================

[![Package version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/daniel-km/deepzoom.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/daniel-km/deepzoom)

[Deepzoom] is a stand-alone library to generate tiles of big images in order to
zoom them instantly. The format of tiles is [DZI] and they can be used with
[OpenSeadragon], [OpenLayers] and various viewers.

It is integrated in the module [IIIF Server] of the open source digital library
[Omeka S] to create images compliant with the specifications of the [International Image Interoperability Framework].

This library is available as a packagist [package].


Usage
-----

### Direct use without the factory

```php
    // Setup the Deepzoom library.
    $deepzoom = new \DanielKm\Deepzoom\Deepzoom($config);

    // Process a source file and save tiles in a destination folder.
    $result = $deepzoom->process($source, $destination);
```

### Direct invocation with the factory

```php
    // Setup the Deepzoom library.
    $factory = new \DanielKm\Deepzoom\DeepzoomFactory;
    $deepzoom = $factory($config);

    // Process a source file and save tiles in a destination folder.
    $result = $deepzoom->process($source, $destination);
```


Supported image libraries
-------------------------

The format of the image source can be anything that is managed by the image
library:

- PHP Extension [GD] (>=2.0)
- PHP extension [Imagick] (>=6.5.6)
- Command line `convert` [ImageMagick] (>=6.0)

The PHP library `exif` should be installed (generally enabled by default).


History
-------

The source is a mix of the Laravel plugin [deepzoom] of Jeremy Tubbs, the
standalone open zoom builder [deepzoom.php] of Nicolas Fabre, the [blog] of
Olivier Mariott, and the similar [Zoomify library].

Some code is shared with the [Zoomify Library].


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

It’s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
---------------
